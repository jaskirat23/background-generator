# Background-Generator
Background Generator Exercise from the Udemy course by Andrei Neagoie (https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-web-developer-zero-to-mastery)

Using the 3 files for the Background Generator, A few things I had to try: 

1. Write code so that the colour inputs match the background generated on the first page load. 

2. Display the initial CSS linear gradient property on page load.

3. BONUS: Add a random button which generates two random numbers for the colour inputs.
